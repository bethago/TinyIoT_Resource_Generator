# TinyIoT Resource Generator

This project is a Python script designed to generate entities on a TinyIoT server based on a JSON file created by the [oneM2M Design Tool](https://github.com/seslabSJU/onem2m_design_tool).

## ðŸ“Œ Description
The script reads JSON files located in the `/data/` folder and sends requests to a TinyIoT server to create entities such as AE (Application Entity) and CNT (Container) in the specified order.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (Install using `pip install requests`)

## ðŸ”§ Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your JSON files in the `/data/` folder.
3. Install the `requests` library:
```
pip install requests
```
## ðŸ“Œ Configuration
The server URL is set to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. You can change it in the `resourceGenerator.py` file:
```python
SERVER_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/'
```

## ðŸš€ Usage
Run the script with Python:
```
python resourceGenerator.py
```
You will see a prompt listing all the JSON files available in the `/data/` folder. Enter the number corresponding to the file you want to use.

### Example Output
```
[0] testdata.json
[1] yourdata.json
Enter the number of the file you want to read: 0
AE 'myAE1' is ready.
AE 'myAE2' is ready.
CNT 'myCNT4' is ready under 'TinyIoT/myAE2'.
CNT 'myCNT1' is ready under 'TinyIoT/myAE1'.
CNT 'myCNT2' is ready under 'TinyIoT/myAE1'.
CNT 'myCNT3' is ready under 'TinyIoT/myAE1'.
CNT 'mySUBCNT1' is ready under 'TinyIoT/myAE1/myCNT1'.
CNT 'mySUBCNT2' is ready under 'TinyIoT/myAE1/myCNT1'.
CNT 'mySUBCNT3' is ready under 'TinyIoT/myAE1/myCNT1'.
```

## ðŸ“Œ JSON File Example
The JSON files can be generated by the [oneM2M Design Tool](https://github.com/seslabSJU/onem2m_design_tool) or you can make it yourself. Generated JSON files must be placed in the `/data/` folder. The tool generates files that describe entities hierarchically.
